# Text Model Based Reinforcement Learning

IDEA: develop a model-based agent for the environment proposed by: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08210

Notes:
1. I'm working with a custom version of the environment Read To Fight Monsters (RTFM). The original version can be found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/RTFM, 
 but I'm using a modified version available at https://github.com/nicoladainese96/RTFM. 
2. To see the scripts from RTFM, the files inside the repository need to be installed with pip (e.g. 'pip install -e .' from inside the cloned directory).
